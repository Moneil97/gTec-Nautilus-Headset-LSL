# gTec-Nautilus-Headset-LSL
Takes the EEG Data output of the g.Nautilus Block (provided by gTec) and outputs it to Lab Streaming Layer as [1x32] samples.
This was made for 32 channel headsets, but will likely work for 64 as well (with minor modifications)

Users will need to have g.Nautilus installed and added to their matlab paths to use this.
